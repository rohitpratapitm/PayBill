PayBill – Utility app for electricity bill payments.

Description: A secure app to pay monthly electricity bills for the state of MPCZ.

Challenge:

As of now the electricity bill payments are made via MPCZ website only. It requires a User a lot of information like his Account Id, mobile number, and email id to view the bill.
Once the bill is displayed it requires payment information like cards etc. to make the payment.

All the aforementioned steps consumes a lot of time of the User and make the payment process cumbersome and time taking.

Solution:

To make the payment process hassle free, I have developed an app called PayBill that stores User’s account information and do the bill payment in 3 clicks without prompting any user information.

Salient Features:
1.	Multiple User Accounts can be added.
2.	Sets auto reminder for next bill payment date.
3.	Stores transaction history.

Technical Details:

To make the app light weighted I have used HttpURLConnection for handling GET/POST request and response.
